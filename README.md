# Image Gallery App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project uses Auth0 (https://auth0.com/) for authentication and Unsplash API (https://unsplash.com/developers) for images

To set up this project:

1. Go to Auth0 (https://auth0.com/) and create an SPA (Single Page Application). Under the Settings tab, look for `Application URIs` and set http://localhost:3000/ as `Allowed Callback URL`, `Allowed Logout URL` and `Allowed Web Origin`, scroll to the bottom of the page and click save (Take note of the `Domain` and `Client ID` at the beginning of the Settings tab)

2. Go to Unsplash for Developers (https://unsplash.com/developers) and create an Application (Take note of the `Access Key`)

## Environment Variables

In the root project directory, create a .env file:

### `REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN=YOUR AUTH0 DOMAIN`
### `REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=YOUR CLIENT ID`
### `REACT_APP_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR UNSPLASH ACCESS KEY`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs the all necessary packages and dependencies for the project

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
